# Rainbow Six:Siege Operator Roulette
This project gives the user a varying number of random operators (of the Game "Rainbow Six:Siege"). The single version only gives one operator at a time, while the full version will give up to five operators according to your choosing.
## Getting started
### Prerequisites
Operator Roulette runs on Python 3.6, so you need to install Python first. A good tutorial of this may be found [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
### Installing
After donwloading and installing Python you are pretty much set. Just run the .pyw file by double clicking on it and you are ready.
### Usage
First, you must select a mode (attack or defense) and then you must select the number of random operators (only full version). By clicking go there will now be a random selection of operators (or one in the single version) according to your selection. By clicking go again the script will choose new operators according to the preferences.
