# Rainbow Six:Siege Operator Roulette
This project gives the user a varying number of random operators (of the Game "Rainbow Six:Siege"). This is done by some python code through which a simple user interface is created.
## Getting started
### Prerequisites
Operator Roulette runs on Python 3.6, so you need to install Python first. A good tutorial of this may be found [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
